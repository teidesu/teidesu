### Brief
- üå∏ I am **Alisa** aka `teidesu`
- üéÄ Fullstack **js/ts** dev, student, weeb and part-time anime girl based in Moscow
- ‚ú® Enjoy building cool things, discovering, inventing and analysing different protocols and algorithms
- ü¶• Not looking for official jobs *(yet)*, but open for commissions
- üßê Currently exploring WebGL and VR
- üé≤ Sometimes post random stuff in my Telegram channel (Russian) [@teipond](//t.me/teipond)
- üí∞ I like money, [plz donate](//tei.su/donate)

### My projects
#### Most of my time I currently spend working on
 - [mtcute](//github.com/mtcute/mtcute), which is a TypeScript library for [MTProto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) clients and bots
 - **???**, which is a large project and I'm not ready to elaborate on it just yet 
 - and nothing else at the moment (but I have tons of ideas and probably will never have enough time to implement them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).
